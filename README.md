## Recomposing this app

`lib/` is fully installer-generated and disposable - it is safe to delete
and is gitignored. Anything app-specific lives in tracked manifests
(`app_routes`, or `host_routes` in `composer.json`), never in `lib/` itself.

To regenerate it:

```sh
python3 .rokct/initiate.py   # provisions the composer under .rokct/skills/
python3 .rokct/skills/.rok/flutter/scripts/compose.py
```

Session cleanup (`python3 .rokct/end_protocol.py`) wipes the provisioned
tools again.
